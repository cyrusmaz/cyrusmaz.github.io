[This](https://github.com/emadzadegan/emadzadegan.github.io/blob/master/files/3431proj_report.pdf) was my final project report for STA3431, a graduate course in Monte Carlo methods as offered by the University of Toronto. It was an exploration of a trend-following trading strategy based on moving averages, a tight risk management strategy, as well as adaptation mechanism.
