[This document](https://github.com/cyrusmaz/cyrusmaz.github.io/blob/master/files/Probability.pdf) contains the my solutions to selected exercises from Rick Durrett's [Probability: Theory and Examples, 4th edition](http://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/PTE/PTE5_011119.pdf) (Note that this link leads to the 5th edition of the book as the author appears to have removed the 4th edition from his website.)
