[This](https://github.com/emadzadegan/emadzadegan.github.io/blob/master/files/appliedProjReport.pdf) was my final project for STA2101, a graduate course in Applied Statistics as offered by the University of Toronto. It was largely an exploration and a mathematical reformulation of the paper [Weight Uncertainty in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05424.pdf).
