<a href="https://cyrusmaz.github.io/files/BNN.pdf">This project</a> was largely an exploration and a mathematical reformulation of the paper [Weight Uncertainty in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05424.pdf). Furthermore, it served as a precursor to my next machine learning project, titled [Partial Bayesian Neural Networks](https://cyrusmaz.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/)
