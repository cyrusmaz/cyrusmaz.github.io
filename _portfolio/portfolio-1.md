<a href="https://cyrusmaz.github.io/files/TradingVolatileDerivatives.pdf">Trading Volatile Markets for Profit</a>: My course project for STA3431 (University of Toronto), the graduate course on Monte Carlo mehtods. In this project I explore a trading strategy for the Bitcoin *inverse perpetual swap*. My strategy consists of a trend-following procedure based on moving averages, a tight risk management strategy, as well as an adaptation mechanism. I assess profitability through Monte Carlo simulations. Coded in R and Python.
