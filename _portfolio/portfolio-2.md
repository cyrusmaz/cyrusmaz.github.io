<a href="https://cyrusmaz.github.io/files/CSC_2516_Project.pdf">Partial Bayesian Neural Networks</a>: my course project for CSC 2516 (University of Toronto), the graduate in neural networks. In this project, I introduce a new neural network architectures that hybridizes Bayesian and non-Bayesian neural network architectures. <a href="https://github.com/cyrusmaz/cyrusmaz.github.io/blob/master/files/CSC_2516_Project_code.ipynb">Bayesian Neural Networks</a>

<a href="https://cyrusmaz.github.io/files/BNN.pdf">Bayesian Neural Networks</a>: my course project for STA2101 (University of Toronto), the first graduate course in a two-course sequence on applied statistics. This project is an exploration and a mathematical reformulation of the paper [Weight Uncertainty in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05424.pdf). Furthermore, it served as a precursor to my next machine learning project, listed above.
