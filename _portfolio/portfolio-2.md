From the abstract: 

**We introduce a new neural network architecture called the Partial Bayesian Neural
Network, which, in essence, is a hybrid of Bayesian and non-Bayesian neural
networks. A Bayesian neural network applies the Bayesian paradigm to all the
weights of a neural network, whereas the partial Bayesian neural network randomly
designates a proportion of the networkâ€™s weights to be Bayesian, and the rest to
be non-Bayesian; this proportion is treated as a hyper-parameter of the model.
A partial Bayesian neural network reduces the dimensionality of the posterior
in comparison to a Bayesian neural network, and we found that ensembles of
partial Bayesian neural networks can approximate Bayesian neural networks quite
accurately.**
